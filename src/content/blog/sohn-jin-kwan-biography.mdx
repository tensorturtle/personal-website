*Editor's Note: I created a Wikipedia page to document my grandfather's life and contributions to South Korea's industrial development, but it was rejected by Wikipedia editors. Rather than let this information disappear, I'm publishing it here so that his memory and accomplishments can live on somewhere on the internet. This is for my family, for those who knew him, and for anyone interested in the stories of the people who helped build modern Korea.*
