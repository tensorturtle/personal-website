This is a draft.

The enlightenment made 'respect for objectivity' a globally shared value, arguably more popular than free market capitalism.

We valued humans who could make objective comments on society and the world - scientists, sociologists, philosophers: they are all people whose job is to abstract away the details of subjective human condition and speak in the objective dynamics of large scale systems.

Now we have AI (Alien Intelligence) that is more 'objective' than any human could ever be. It has 'seen' everything from all perspectives, is not limited in time or space. It has no human condition. This alien intelligence spews objectivity, and floods the market for objectivity, causing a massive devaluation of objectivity itself.

I think AI is the inflection point where our want for objectivity is now ironically overfulfilled, leading us back to valuing subjectivity.

It's a great opportunity for existentialism. Kierkegaard had been saying that we should go back, but until we experienced the logical extreme oversaturation of enlightenment-style objectivity, we didn't believe him.

It's like, the only way to get over a song that's stuck in your head is to listen to it until you get sick of it; the only way to get over a food craving is to have so much of it until you don't want it anymore.
