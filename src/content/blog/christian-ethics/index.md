Explanation is not justification.

Presupposing an ethical standard in itself (regardless of the details) crucially divorces naturalistic explanation from moral imperative.

The point of Christian ethics is not the specific rules it gives us but the notion that just because something can be explaned naturalistically does not automatically mean that such behavior can be justified.

Operating in a void of absolute sin, the only virtue for a given behavior is its 'natural'-ness, and therefore a naturalistic explanation of a given behavior morally justifies it.
