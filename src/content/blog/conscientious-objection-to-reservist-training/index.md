1. Conscientious objection is universally and locally accepted.
    + International human rights bodies recognize that the right to conscientious objection is a continuous right that can arise at any time, including after entering or completing military service. The UN Human Rights Committee has stated that individuals should be able to claim conscientious objector status "at any time." 
    + Supreme Court of South Korea has ruled that objection to reserve forces training based on conscience is not a crime, even for those who have completed active duty.

2. There is no grounds to accept the compromises of freedom as established by an immature, underdeveloped society. 
    + According to Hegel, the driving force behind world-historical dialectical progression is the "consciousness of freedom." Early stages of history might see only one person (like a despot) recognized as free. As history moves forward, more and more individuals come to be recognized as free, and the understanding of what constitutes freedom becomes more profound and comprehensive. This culminates in a society organized according to rational principles that guarantee the freedom of its members. (Gemini 2.0 flash with prompt: "Did Hegel think that society progressed towards self-realization of rationality and freedom?")
    + Reservist training as implemented in South Korea (mandated by law, no compensation) clashes with my understanding of civil freedom that I hold reasonable and common sensical for those who have already completed 18 months of active military duty. It is clear that the law and society of South Korea lags behind my more progressive stage of world-historical dialectical progression.
    + In short, I believe that my freedom is not available to be negociated at the rates / conditions proposed by South Korean law.

3. Given that my freedom is not negociable, and given that it is possible to evade reservist training by travelling abroad, in effect evading reservist training is not structurally different from an income tax.
    + If I don't pay income taxes, the government threatens me with more fines and potential jail time.
    + If I don't pay to travel abroad when I am assigned reservist training, assuming I will not show up to reservist training (due to non-negociable personal freedom), the government similarly threatens me with more fines and potential jail time.

Thus I am obligated to travel abroad in order to evade reservist training in order to live an authentic life.

For solo stays at airport hotels, it's a thing that John Carmack does when he needs time to focus and study something.

## Allostatic Load

Allostatic load refers to the cumulative biological dysregulation resulting from chronic stress or prolonged exposure to life stressors.

I have felt severe subconscious, quite physiological hormonal and nervous dysregulation when I was reminded of my situation of being subject to losing my freedom. To me, the thought of military reservist training triggers a fight or flight response. It does so doubly because I think that during my actual 19-month military service, I did neither sufficiently fight or flight the situations I found myself in, and this inaction, this inner peace, allowed the powers above me to disregard my humanity and dignity with utter carelessness. And I only learned this near the very end of my service, where I stood up for 수민, and that action actually led him to be re-assigned to a different team. This demonstrated that it was indeed possible to make a difference in one's situation after all. Further dramatic moments also influenced by thinking at the time, such as when I ran for senior KATUSA but was disqualified unreasonably. My intention here is not to blame myself for not standing up for myself but rather to explain my now overdeveloped sensitivity for the need to stand up for oneself against such injustices.
